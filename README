Description
This is a simple word game created using JavaScript. The game displays a European dish as a word with missing letters, and the player's task is to guess the letters one by one. The player has a limited number of attempts, and if they run out of attempts before guessing the word, they lose. If they successfully guess the word, they win.

How to Play
When you start the game, you will see a European dish name displayed as underscores (e.g., "_ _ _ _ _ _").
You have 7 attempts to guess the letters in the word.
Enter a letter in the input field and click the "Enter" button to guess.
If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in its corresponding position in the word.
If the letter is incorrect, your remaining attempts will decrease.
Continue guessing letters until you either complete the word or run out of attempts.
The game will end with a message: "Game Over! You lost" if you run out of attempts or "Congrats! You won" if you successfully guess the word.

The game will automatically display letters you've guessed correctly in their correct positions.
